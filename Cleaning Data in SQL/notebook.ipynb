{"cells":[{"source":"# Cleaning Data in SQL\nData from your queries may often contain missing values, duplicate rows, or data in the wrong format. It is crucial to be able to clean the data you retrieve through your queries. This template runs through the basics of handling missing data, duplicate rows, and string cleaning.\n\nThis template connects to a database containing different course datasets by default. However, you can use any integration you want, so long as you have access to a table with text data. You can learn more about integrations [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/integrations/what-is-an-integration).\n\nðŸ’¡&nbsp;&nbsp;_The data we will use is contained various schemas of the Course Databases database. To edit the queries, you must add the schema name when referencing tables in this database (e.g., `world.currencies`)._","metadata":{},"id":"da6650da-d7a1-4842-81fb-2ccc2f9873a6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Missing values\nMissing or null values are common in data and can often present a problem for future analyses. You can inspect the number of missing values in a column by filtering the data for null values and performing an aggregation. \n\nIn the example below, we filter for records where the `unemployment_rate` is `NULL` and then `COUNT()` the number of rows.","metadata":{},"id":"37bc08c7-0f6f-4134-b252-ad51740def40","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_missing_unemployment_rates\nFROM world.economies\nWHERE unemployment_rate IS NULL","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","initial":false,"integrationId":"c632441c-e1dc-4637-a56d-10b85efd89be"},"id":"21598225-4b3c-4195-9919-823263ef516b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### Filling missing values\nOnce you have identified the missing values, you can handle them in several ways. \n\nHere, we use `COALESCE()` to replace NULL values with the average unemployment rate (which is accessed via a subquery). `COALESCE()` works by returning the first argument if it is not null. If it is null, it returns the second argument, and so forth. If the `unemployment_rate` column is `NULL`, it returns the second argument, which is the average unemployment we calculate with a subquery.","metadata":{},"id":"354d632b-ee22-4b9d-b04d-5eb147499015","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"SELECT\n\tcode,\n    unemployment_rate,\n\tCOALESCE(unemployment_rate, \n             (SELECT AVG(unemployment_rate) FROM world.economies)) AS filled_unemployment_rate\nFROM world.economies","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","initial":false,"integrationId":"c632441c-e1dc-4637-a56d-10b85efd89be"},"id":"94bb3992-3277-472c-913a-29330661049b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Duplicate rows\nAnother data issue you may come across is duplicate rows.
