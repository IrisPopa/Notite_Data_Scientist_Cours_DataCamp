{"cells":[{"source":"# Window Functions in SQL\n\nWindow functions are used to perform calculations on a group of rows without combining them into a single result. This can be useful when you are calculating metrics such as an average over a period of time or a running total. Unlike a `GROUP BY`, it does not group rows into a single row. In this workspace, you will learn:\n- How to define a window function that includes a set of rows \n- How to divide the set of rows included within a window function into partitions or frames\n- How to calculate moving averages and running totals.\n\nThis workspace uses the Olympics data from the course [PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/postgresql-summary-stats-and-window-functions). You are free to create an integration to your own data or use one of the existing integrations. You can learn more about integrations [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/integrations/what-is-an-integration).","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"4660447b-3e8e-47db-9953-110ed51719b9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Calculating row numbers\nThe example below uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign a row number to each row.
