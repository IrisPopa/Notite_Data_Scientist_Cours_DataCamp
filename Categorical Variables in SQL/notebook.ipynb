Working with categorical data is an essential skill as a data analyst or data scientist. This template will teach you how to inspect, create, filter, and aggregate categorical variables.\n\nThis tutorial will use Summer Olympics data. You are free to create an integration to your data set or use another existing integration. You can learn more about integrations [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/integrations/what-is-an-integration).\n\n_Note: The databases from different PostgreSQL courses are available in the Course Databases database. You can click the \"Browse tables\" button in the upper righthand corner of the cell below to view the available schemas and tables. The data used for this workspace is contained in the medals schema. To access each table, you need to specify this schema in your queries (e.g., medals.summer_medals for the summer_medals table)._","metadata":{},"id":"acf929b3-ca35-48e0-adfc-fad5ab49aa0c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Inspecting categorical variables\n\nOften, you will want to know the unique values in a categorical column.
